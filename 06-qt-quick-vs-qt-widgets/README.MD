![Episode Image](episode_image.png)

## Episode Purpose
In this episode, we'll explore the two main approaches for GUI development in the Qt framework: Qt Widgets and Qt Quick. 

We'll discuss the key differences between these approaches, their strengths, and considerations. You'll learn about Qt Widgets, which provide a mature and C++-based approach to building GUI applications, and Qt Quick (QML), which offers a modern and declarative way to create rich and animated user interfaces. 

We'll discuss the pros and cons of each approach, including their suitability for different platforms, ease of customization, and performance considerations. By the end of this episode, you'll have a clear understanding of when to choose Qt Widgets or Qt Quick for your GUI development projects.
