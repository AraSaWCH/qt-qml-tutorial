# Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) and magic behind QObject - Qt QML Tutorial #5 

![Episode Image](episode_image.png)

## Episode Purpose
In this episode, we'll dive into the Meta Object Compiler (MOC) and explore how it works in the Qt framework. 

We'll start by locating the MOC-generated files in the build folder of a Qt project. 

Next, we'll focus on properties in Qt's Meta-Object System. 
We'll explore a technical example of declaring a property using the UserInteractor class from a previous episode.

By understanding the role of MOC and properties in Qt, you'll have a deeper grasp of the underlying mechanisms that make Qt powerful and flexible for application development.
