## Code Short Description
In this coding example, an application has been created to simulate a house wall that you want to decorate. The wall is represented as a plain, yellowish surface.

To decorate the wall, paintings in the form of plain rectangles have been hung. Each painting is positioned using a different approach to showcase the various techniques.

A large `GridLayout` with 2 columns and 2 rows serves as the main layout. The grid layout utilizes anchors to fill the window. The paintings are positioned as follows:

- In the top-left cell of the grid, a container item has been placed, and within that container, the picture is positioned using `x` and `y` properties.

- In the top-right cell, another container has been created, and within that container, the picture is positioned using anchors.

- In the bottom-left cell, the `Flow` layout is used to place 5 identical images.

- Finally, in the bottom-right cell, another `GridLayout` is nested to hang 3 more images.

Each cell has been encapsulated in empty Item, so other positioners won't break whole wall.

The use of a `Repeater` item allows for the creation of multiple instances of the same-looking element, in this case, paintings.
