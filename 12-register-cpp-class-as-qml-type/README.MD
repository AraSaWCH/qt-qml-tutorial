# How to integrate C++ and QML? Register C++ class as QML type - Qt QML Tutorial #12

![Episode Image](episode_image.png)

## Episode Purpose
In this episode, you will explore the process of registering C++ types to QML in Qt. The episode will cover the differences between registering types and exposing objects, the benefits of separating the backend logic from the QML interface, and the various macros available for registering C++ types, such as `QML_ELEMENT`, `QML_NAMED_ELEMENT`, `QML_ANONYMOUS`, `QML_UNCREATABLE`, and `QML_FOREIGN`.

## Code Short Description
Continuation of developing Spotify-like app.

All properties of the `AudioInfoBox` item are moved to the backend by creating a new class called `AudioInfo`. This class provides additional information about a song, such as its file path, image source, title, and author. Additionally, `PlayerController` class now actually plays the audio using the source as an argument. `QMediaPlayer` class from the Qt Multimedia module is used to achieve this.

To register the `AudioInfo` class to QML, in the CMakeLists file, instead of adding the files directly to the executable, they are included inside the `qt_add_qml_module` directive under the `SOURCES` keyword.

Next, to make the `AudioInfo` type creatable in QML, the `QML_ELEMENT` macro has been added to our new class.

By registering the `AudioInfo` class, we can use it as a QML element in the `AudioInfoBox` item and benefit from the separation of backend logic and QML interface.
