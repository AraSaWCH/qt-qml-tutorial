## Code Short Description
In this coding example, there's a simple QML application with two buttons. The first button prints a message to the console output when clicked, while the second button closes the entire application.

To gain a better understanding of QML's workings, we used a custom button instead of using the built-in QML types. However, note that it is generally recommended to use existing QML types for buttons in real-world scenarios. For the sake of simplicity, we created a basic rectangular button that can change color based on user interactions.

The button consists of a plain rectangle, a `Text` element, and a `MouseArea` element for handling mouse events. Property bindings were utilized to change the button's color when the mouse hovers over it or when it is pressed.

Furthermore, there's a slot that will be invoked when the button is pressed, allowing us to perform custom actions.

To create multiple buttons with different functionalities, we created copies of the button item and defined their respective slots. In future episodes, you will explore how to create such buttons as separate types.
